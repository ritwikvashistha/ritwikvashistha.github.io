<h2>About My Research</h2>
<p>
  
My current research focus is on building robust and reliable machine learning models. During my PhD, i have developed frameworks to evaluate trustworthiness of binary classifiers for decision making and doing inference respectively. 
I am currently working on building hypothesis testing and learning methods that can deal with noisy data.
