Hi, I am a third year PhD student in Statistics at University of Texas at Austin. I am currently doing research broadly related to building robust and reliable machine learning models for decison making. To learn more about my research projects, please check out [Research](https://ritwikvashistha.github.io/research/). I hope to talk about my projects in more detail later in blog posts and share the slides as well. At UT, I am advised by [Dr. Arya Farahi](https://stat.utexas.edu/directory/arya-farahi) and also a part of [CosmicAI institute](https://www.cosmicai.org/team). 


If you'd like to know more about me, I also have a [personal website](https://www.ritwikvashistha.com/). It is more of a creative outlet, where I share my experiences and post some photos I took while travelling!
